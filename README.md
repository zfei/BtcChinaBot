BTC China Bot
===========

This bot runs on [BTC China](https://vip.btcchina.com), aka the heaven of trading bots, where transaction fee is 0%.
Currently it only follows simple heuristics (buy low and sell high), and acts as a scalper. Indicators will be added.

git clone https://github.com/zfei/BtcChinaBot
